# Data-Scientist-Job-Roles-Salaries-in-the-US
A comprehensive analytical Power BI dashboard that explores salary variations, visa classifications, job roles, wage differences, and career progression across the United States (2008–2015). The dashboard provides insights valuable for recruiters, data analysts, immigration specialists, and policymakers.
#  Project Objective

To analyze and visualize how salary levels, visa types, job titles, hiring company sizes, and wage variations differ across industries and over time.
The dashboard aims to reveal high-paying job categories, wage progression trends, and visa-based hiring patterns in the US job market.

# Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes wage and job-role data submitted through U.S. immigration filings.
The dashboard includes:

Salary trends (2008–2015)

Visa class distribution across job titles

Wage differences among roles

Boxplots for compensation spread

Company size hiring patterns

Case status breakdown (certified, denied, withdrawn)

Comparison among job roles such as:
Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Software Engineer, Teacher, Attorney, Consultant

The goal is to understand role-based salary trends, visa class dominance, and shifts in industry hiring behavior.

# Business Questions / Key Analysis Areas

Which job roles earn the highest and lowest wages?

How do salaries vary by visa class (H-1B, H-1B1 Chile, H-1B1 Singapore, E-3)?

What are the salary trends from 2008 to 2015?

What is the wage difference between the highest and lowest paying job roles?

Which job titles have the widest salary range (via boxplots)?

Is there a correlation between company size and employee wage?

How do case statuses (certified, denied, withdrawn) impact hiring trends?
